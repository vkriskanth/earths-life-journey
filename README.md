# Earth's Life Journey Timeline

## Description

This project is an interactive, single-page website that takes the user on a scrolling journey back through Earth's geological and biological history. Starting from the Present Day, as the user scrolls down, they travel backwards in time, encountering key eons, eras, periods, significant evolutionary milestones, major geological events, and representative life forms.

The visual style is inspired by sites like Neal Agarwal's "The Deep Sea," providing a sense of depth and progression through time. A dynamic time indicator stays on screen, updating to reflect the historical period currently in view.

## Features

*   **Vertical Scrolling Timeline:** Navigate through Earth's history by scrolling.
*   **Dynamic Time Indicator:** Shows the current geological period or "years ago" based on scroll depth.
*   **Key Milestones:** Features over 25 distinct sections detailing important events and life forms.
*   **Simple Visuals:** Includes SVG icons for representative organisms and events.
*   **Responsive Design:** Basic responsiveness for different screen sizes.
*   **Fade-in Animations:** Sections and their content fade in as they scroll into view.

## How to Run Locally

1.  **Clone or Download the Repository:**
    *   If you have Git: `git clone <repository_url>` (Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL)
    *   Alternatively, download the ZIP file from the repository page and extract it.
2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    *   `cd <project_directory_name>` (Replace `<project_directory_name>` with the actual folder name)
3.  **Open `index.html`:**
    *   Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
    *   No special server is needed; it can be run directly from the local file system.

## File Structure

The main files in this project are:

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure and content of the website.
*   `style.css`: The CSS file for styling all aspects of the website.
*   `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the dynamic time indicator and scroll animations.
*   **SVG Icons:**
    *   `trilobite.svg`
    *   `dinosaur_silhouette.svg`
    *   `early_tree.svg`
    *   `asteroid_impact.svg`
    *   `hominin_silhouette.svg`
    *   `stromatolite.svg`
    *   `flower_icon.svg`

    (These icon files are located in the same directory as `index.html`).

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

*   More detailed visuals and a wider variety of icons.
*   More complex animations (e.g., parallax scrolling).
*   Interactive elements within sections (e.g., clicking on an icon to get more info).
*   Sound effects or ambient background audio.
